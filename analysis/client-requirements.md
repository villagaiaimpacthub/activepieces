# Client Requirements Analysis

## Client Personas and Use Cases

### Primary Client Type: Mid-Market Companies (50-500 employees)
**Characteristics:**
- Have existing manual SOPs (Word docs, PDFs, tribal knowledge)
- Want to digitize and automate procedures
- Need visual process mapping before automation
- Limited technical expertise but understand business processes
- Budget for process improvement but not enterprise software

### Client Pain Points
1. **Current SOPs are static documents** - Word/PDF files that get outdated
2. **No visual process mapping** - Hard to understand complex workflows
3. **Inconsistent execution** - Different people follow procedures differently
4. **Automation gap** - Want AI automation but don't know how to specify requirements
5. **Documentation burden** - Creating comprehensive SOPs is time-intensive

## Use Case Analysis

### Use Case 1: Client-Facing SOP Designer (Primary)

**Client Journey:**
1. **Discovery Call** - We understand their current processes
2. **Tool Access** - Client gets branded SOP design interface  
3. **Process Mapping** - Client drags/drops to map their workflow
4. **Specification Export** - Tool generates detailed automation spec
5. **Implementation** - We build AI automations from their spec
6. **Deployment** - Client gets automated system

**Client Requirements:**
- **Intuitive interface** - No learning curve for business users
- **SOP-specific language** - Steps, approvals, checkpoints (not generic "actions")
- **Visual workflow** - See the entire process flow at a glance
- **Export capability** - Get detailed spec for automation implementation
- **Branded experience** - Feels like our solution, not generic workflow tool

### Use Case 2: Template-Based Approach (Secondary)

**Client Journey:**
1. **Template Selection** - Choose from common SOP patterns
2. **Customization** - Fill in business-specific details
3. **Process Review** - Validate the generated workflow
4. **Specification Generation** - Auto-create automation requirements
5. **Implementation** - We build from standardized template

**Template Categories:**
- **HR Onboarding** - New employee setup procedures
- **Sales Process** - Lead qualification to deal closure
- **Customer Support** - Ticket resolution workflows
- **Quality Control** - Product inspection and approval
- **Compliance** - Regulatory requirement workflows

## Functional Requirements

### Core Interface Requirements

**1. SOP-Specific Navigation**
```
Navigation Should Show:
├── My SOPs                    (not "My Flows")
├── Process Library           (not "Piece Library")
├── Templates                 (SOP templates)
├── Export Center            (download specs)
└── Help & Training          (SOP-focused help)
```

**2. Drag-and-Drop Process Builder**
- **Process Steps** (instead of generic actions)
- **Decision Points** (if/then logic with business language)
- **Approval Gates** (human approval with role assignment)
- **Data Collection** (forms and inputs)
- **Notifications** (alerts and communications)
- **Documentation** (automatic procedure documentation)

**3. SOP-Specific Workflow Pieces**
```typescript
// Example SOP pieces clients need
const sopPieces = [
  'Process Step',           // Basic procedure step
  'Approval Required',      // Human approval gate
  'Document Review',        // File/document validation
  'Data Entry Form',        // Structured data collection
  'Email Notification',     // Process status updates
  'Compliance Check',       // Regulatory validation
  'Quality Gate',          // Quality control checkpoint
  'Escalation Trigger',    // Exception handling
  'Progress Tracker',      // Status monitoring
  'Final Documentation'    // Process completion record
];
```

### Data Export Requirements

**Export Formats Needed:**
1. **PDF Process Map** - Visual workflow for human reference
2. **JSON Specification** - Technical spec for automation implementation
3. **Word Documentation** - Traditional SOP document format
4. **YAML Configuration** - Clean config format for developers

**Export Content Must Include:**
- Process flow with decision logic
- Role assignments and permissions
- Data requirements and validation rules
- Integration points and external systems
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Performance metrics and KPIs

### Branding and UI Requirements

**Visual Identity:**
- Remove "Activepieces" branding entirely
- Custom logo and color scheme
- Professional, enterprise appearance
- SOP-focused terminology throughout

**Interface Simplification:**
- Hide advanced workflow features clients don't need
- Show only SOP-relevant pieces in drag-drop palette
- Simplified menus focused on process creation
- Context-sensitive help for SOP design

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Load Time** - Interface loads in <3 seconds
- **Workflow Rendering** - Complex SOPs render in <2 seconds  
- **Export Generation** - Specs export in <10 seconds
- **Concurrent Users** - Support 50+ clients simultaneously

### Integration Requirements
- **Single Sign-On** - Client can use existing authentication
- **White Label** - Complete customization for our brand
- **Multi-Tenant** - Isolated workspaces per client
- **API Access** - Programmatic access to client workflows

### Security Requirements
- **Data Isolation** - Complete separation between clients
- **Access Control** - Role-based permissions within client orgs
- **Audit Trail** - Complete log of changes and access
- **Compliance** - SOC2/GDPR ready for enterprise clients

## Success Criteria

### Client Success Metrics
- **Time to First SOP** - Client creates first process map in <30 minutes
- **Completion Rate** - 90% of started SOPs are completed and exported
- **User Adoption** - 80% of client team members use the tool
- **Specification Quality** - Generated specs require minimal clarification

### Business Success Metrics  
- **Client Onboarding** - 50% faster client onboarding with visual tool
- **Project Scope** - Clearer project requirements reduce scope creep
- **Implementation Speed** - 30% faster automation delivery
- **Client Satisfaction** - Higher satisfaction with collaborative approach

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget Limitation** - Must leverage Activepieces, not build from scratch
- **Timeline** - Need working prototype in 4 weeks
- **Technical Skills** - Clients are business users, not technical users
- **Existing Processes** - Must accommodate varied current-state processes

### Assumptions
- Clients have existing SOPs in some form
- Business users can learn drag-and-drop interface
- Visual process mapping adds value over written requirements
- Exported specifications will be sufficient for implementation
- Clients prefer collaborative design over consultative interviews

## Risk Analysis

### High-Risk Items
- **User Adoption** - Business users may resist new tools
- **Complexity Creep** - Clients may want advanced features we can't support
- **Export Quality** - Generated specs may be incomplete or unclear

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Extensive User Testing** - Test with real clients early and often
- **Feature Discipline** - Strict scope management on customizations
- **Specification Templates** - Standardized export formats with validation
