## Execution Priority Matrix

### Critical Path (Must Complete First)
1. Repository Setup → Development Environment → Codebase Analysis
2. Common Framework → Individual Pieces → Piece Integration
3. Export Service → Export Implementation → End-to-End Testing
4. Integration Testing → Production Deployment

### Parallel Execution Groups
```
GROUP A (Phase 1 - Level 0): Agents 1, 2, 3 - Launch Simultaneously
GROUP B (Phase 1 - Level 1): Agents 4, 5 - After Group A = 100%
GROUP C (Phase 1 - Level 2): Agent 6 - After Group B = 100%

GROUP D (Phase 2 - Level 0): Agents 7, 8, 9 - After Phase 1 = 100%
GROUP E (Phase 2 - Level 1): Agents 10, 11, 12 - After Group D = 100%
GROUP F (Phase 2 - Level 2): Agent 13 - After Group E = 100%

GROUP G (Phase 3 - Level 0): Agents 14, 15, 16 - After Phase 2 = 100%
GROUP H (Phase 3 - Level 1): Agents 17, 18, 19 - After Group G = 100%
GROUP I (Phase 3 - Level 2): Agents 20, 21, 22 - After Group H = 100%
GROUP J (Phase 3 - Level 3): Agent 23 - After Group I = 100%

GROUP K (Phase 4 - Level 0): Agents 24, 25, 26 - After Phase 3 = 100%
GROUP L (Phase 4 - Level 1): Agents 27, 28, 29 - After Group K = 100%
GROUP M (Phase 4 - Level 2): Agents 30, 31 - After Group L = 100%
GROUP N (Phase 4 - Level 3): Agent 32 - After Group M = 100%
```

## Orchestrator Launch Sequence

### Ready to Launch: GROUP A (3 Agents)
**All have ZERO dependencies - can start immediately**

1. **Agent 1: Repository Setup**
   - Fork Activepieces repository
   - Setup branch structure
   - Configure remotes

2. **Agent 2: Environment Setup** 
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure environment files
   - Verify basic installation

3. **Agent 3: Basic Configuration**
   - Setup development configuration
   - Create initial file structure
   - Prepare asset directories

### Blocked/Waiting: All Other Groups
- GROUP B waits for GROUP A completion (100% scores)
- All subsequent groups wait for their dependencies
- No agent launches until prerequisites are 100% complete

## Orchestrator Responsibilities

### Before Each Agent Launch
1. **Verify Dependencies**: All prerequisite tasks scored 100%
2. **Provide Complete Context**: Use context template from execution.md
3. **Set Success Criteria**: Define exactly what constitutes 100% completion
4. **Monitor Execution**: Track 10-minute time limit
5. **Validate Completion**: Verify deliverables and score

### Context Template for Each Agent
```
AGENT CONTEXT:
- Project: Activepieces SOP Tool (client-facing SOP design with export)
- Current Phase: [Phase X - Task Y]  
- Dependencies Met: [List completed prerequisites]
- Specific Task: [Exact work to be performed]
- Success Criteria: [How to achieve 100% score]
- Deliverables: [Files to create/modify]
- Time Limit: 10 minutes maximum
- Integration: [How this connects to other components]
```

This dependency graph ensures proper sequencing while maximizing parallel execution and maintaining the 100% completion requirement.
